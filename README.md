# Marty's Let's Build A Compiler Code

My attempt at following along with Crenshaw's "Let's Build a Compiler" course,
only in C and i386.

I diverge a little in section 13...

10m - KISS:
  * Multichar keywords and variables
  * READ and WRITE (with assembly!)

11 - Scanner revisited

12 - Comments and optional semicolons

13 - Function Calls
