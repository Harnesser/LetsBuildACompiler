For the compiler I'm writing, I need to be able to
read a number from the terminal.

I'll be using the linux SYS_READ system call, which
will get me as far as an ascii string. I'll do my own
version of atoi() for a laugh to convert this string
to an integer that I can then do calculations on.

The functions were developed in this directory, but the
meat of the functions are in an include file that I can
easily port into the compiler's assembly listing.
